SPP is a cheap-o proxy for Phantasy Star Online (Game Cube only, Episodes 1&2
and 3). It's simply bundled because it can be - I wrote it to analyse packets
that server(s) send when writing lobbylurk.

Execution
*********

To run it, use the syntax:

    spp <server IP> <port>

SPP will run on the local machine at <port>, and will also connect to the
server on it.

DNS Server
**********

A DNS server is provided (written by Kohle) with SPP which should run while SPP
is running so the Game Cube can connect. It can be found in ../dnsserver.
